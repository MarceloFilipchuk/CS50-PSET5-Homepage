                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to my very first website. It was designed as an assignment for the CS50 course, given by HarvardX. I will now proceed to try several types of text formats.
                <br>The three most used formats are the following:
                <br>This one is called <b>"bold"</b>
                <br>This one is called <i>"italic"</i>
                <br>This one is called <del>"deleted</del></p>
                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>I was born in Argentina. At age 18 I entered in medschool. At age 24 I got my degree and recently developed an interest for programming.
                I started practicing with some python exercises I found online until I stumbled upon the CS50 course, which I took without even doubting it
                Until now I find it very useful for learning from zero. But although I find C very usefull, I must confess that learning it was a pain in the ass
                I am learning programming in hope of working as a software developer until I get my medical licence, once I fulfill my dream of leaving Argentina,
                hopefully stablishing myself in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
